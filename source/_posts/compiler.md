## Background

{% fa_css %}

This course project for CSE 40243 [_Compilers and Language Design_](
https://dthain.github.io/compilers-fa23/), offered in Fall 2023 at the
University of Notre Dame, was taught by Prof. Douglas Thain. I also had the
privilege of working with Dr. Thain during the summer of 2022.

As a side "note", the notes I took for this course can be found [{% fa_inline
pen fas %} here](https://notes.sghuang.com/compilers-and-language-design).

## Specification

B-Minor is a language designed by Dr. Thain for teaching this compiler course.
The specification of this language is tweaked slightly each year. The complete
specs of B-Minor 2023 can be found on the [course website](https://dthain.github.io/compilers-fa23/bminor).

In short, it supports:

- Primitive types, arrays, and strings
- `for`, `if`, and `while` control logic
- `print` as a statement instead of a function
- Function calls, including recursion. I decided to implement stack calling
  implemented instead of register calling

{% note primary no-icon %}

This language is named `B-Minor` because `C`, `C-Sharp`, `C-Major`, `C-Minor`
and `B` are all taken, and Dr. Thain prefers minor key over major.

## How I wrote it?

- Encoder, Resolver, Typechecker, Code Generator: Handwritten in C.
- Scanner: Implemented with RegEx and [Flex](https://github.com/westes/flex).
- Parser: Implemented with [Bison](https://gnu.org/software/bison/).

The Context Free Grammar for this project is pretty elegant in my opinion:
