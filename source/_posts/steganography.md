<!-- cSpell:words stegano -->

This course project for Digital Image Processing integrates LSB steganography in
images with Hamming Code error correction. I chose this topic because I was
fascinated by the video made by 3Blue1Brown explaining Hamming Code, and I have
a strong interest in bit operations.

## Challenges Encountered

![accuracy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sghuang19/dip-project-stegano/main/fig/acc.svg)

- Hamming Code cannot recover from excessive bit errors caused by significant
  damage to the image file.
- I wasn’t familiar with Git at the time, the commit history was unclear.

## Successes Achieved

- Several elegant code snippets were developed, which I’m proud of.
- The code is fairly Pythonic, many builtin features are utilized.
- The code is well documented with docstrings.
- The final report is comprehensive.
