This post describes my project for course CSE 40932 _Exotic Computing_ in
Spring 2022. In this project, I developed a UTM with text interface using
Python. It supports several command line options, takes input and rules from
files, and display the steps as the emulator runs.

To know more about this project, visit the
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/sghuang19/unituring/) and read the
[project report](https://github.com/sghuang19/unituring/blob/main/README.md).

As a side-note, during the course, I helped Prof. Kogge fix many typos and
errors from the book he was writing,
[_The Zen of Exotic Computing_](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/1.9781611977295)
and was included in the acknowledgement section.
