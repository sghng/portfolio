This post details my project for SME309 _Microprocessor Design_ in Fall 2021
semester. In this project, I wrote a microprocessor that implements basic
instructions of AMRv3 along with a multi-cycle multiplier. As a side-note, I
achieved a score of 98/100 for this course, and ranked the first in the final
exam.

The processor is written with Verilog, and simulated with Quartus. To know more
about this project, visit the
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/sghuang19/sme309-fa21/), or read the project
reports for
[single-cycle processor](https://github.com/sghuang19/sme309-fa21/blob/main/SME309-Lab-Report.md)
and for
[multiplier](https://github.com/sghuang19/sme309-fa21/blob/main/SME309-Lab-Report-Multiplier.md).

The following figures are from the report.
