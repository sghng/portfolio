This is the project for course CSE 60467 _Data Science_. In this project, I led
a team of three students to conduct analysis on the sentiments of comments
related to climate change on Reddit. I was responsible for clustering analysis
and project management. The dataset we used can be found on
[SocialGrep](https://socialgrep.com/datasets/the-reddit-climate-change-dataset)
For more details, view our
[project report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V8V_Ja0yzIZN5vQ5CHOG-Y6FnPUMNLZlXOPPIAhYdyY).

Here are some of the interesting insights we found from the dataset.

The longer the comment, the stronger the sentiment.

There are more discussions on climate change in summers and winters.
