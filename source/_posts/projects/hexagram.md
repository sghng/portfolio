[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/0820c966-ec6e-499e-9d10-d1728ef116fc/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/hexagram/deploys)

A small React frontend project. The webapp is deployed at
[hexagram.netlify.app](https://hexagram.netlify.app), with code open-sourced on
[GitHub](https://github.com/sghuang19/hexagram).

Tools I used:

- React
- React Query (for handling API caching)
- Framer Motion
- Tailwind CSS (for quick prototyping and responsive design)
- Vite
- Netlify (for deployment)
- ESLint
- Prettier
