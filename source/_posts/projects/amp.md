This project is for course SME307 _CMOS Analog Integrated Circuit Design_ in
2021 Fall semester. We designed and simulated this amplifier with Cadence.

To know more about this project, read our [report](/files/amp.pdf), which is
written in IEEE conference format. The following figures are from the report.
