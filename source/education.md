#### From Sand to Cloud

I frame my academic background as "from sand to cloud", as it spans across the
whole computing spectrum from semiconductor to software engineering and cloud
computing. {% endnote %}

The transition from Microelectronics to Computer Science was out of personal
passion -- to me, Computer Science is philosophical, and it inspires my thoughts
in sociology. political science, and problem solving.
