After completing my
[exchange semester at Notre Dame](/education#Exchange-Student-ND), I continued
my collaboration with Dr. Douglas Thain in the Cooperative Computing Lab. Over
the summer, I honed my skills in Shell, Vim, tmux, Git, and C programming.
Additionally, I made contributions to CCTools, discovering the engaging world of
distributed systems!

For details of my work, take a look at [this post](/cctools).
