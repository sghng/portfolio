This summer internship was my first taste in tech consulting. I conducted two
projects:

**Primary Project:** I contributed to data analytics and dashboard development
for [Thor Industries](http://thorindustries.com), the world’s largest RV company
headquartered in Elkhart, near South Bend. Due to NDA restrictions, I’m unable
to share specific details, but I can highlight the technologies and tools I
utilized in this project. I worked with PowerBI and other Power Platform tools,
alongside Azure services, to develop comprehensive data solutions. Additionally,
I used Python-based data science tools such as Jupyter Notebook, Seaborn,
Matplotlib, and Pandas to perform in-depth data analysis and visualization.

**Secondary Project:** I contributed to Kinga, a personal safety app, as the
sole team member with a software engineering background. After joining, I
conducted a code review of the existing codebase, which led to the decision to
replace our current developer. I then took on the task of redeveloping the app
using React Native and also played a key role in our Indiegogo crowdfunding
campaign.
