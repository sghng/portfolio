After advising several startup teams, I discovered myTickets and ultimately
decided to join them as a Software Engineer. It was a very early-stage venture,
but we successfully secured funding, assembled a strong team, and developed a
tech roadmap that aligns with my vision.

The tech stack we're working with now includes:

- Next.js
- MongoDB
- Prisma ORM
- Tailwind CSS
- Vercel
- TypeScript
