In the summer of 2023, between graduating from SUSTech and starting at Notre
Dame, I had the opportunity to establish a new branch for Blewbo in China.

The journey began with a post in the SUSTech information group chat, seeking a
fluent English speaker to replace an interpreter sidelined by COVID. The job
involved assisting a foreign businessman with setting up bank accounts at China
Merchant Bank and managing tax registrations. Enticed by the interesting
challenge and attractive pay, I quickly accepted.

This initial engagement led me to meet Mr. Elie, who, impressed by my work
during our first afternoon together, offered me the responsibility of handling
all aspects of launching Blewbo's new branch.
