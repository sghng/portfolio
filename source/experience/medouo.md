I met Nancy Li online and learned she was launching an online store selling oil
paintings in the US. Six months later, she reached out for help with
understanding customer phone calls in English. Seeing a good opportunity to
apply my knowledge of business and entrepreneurship, I decided to join her as a
Co-Founder.

In my role, I lead our project management, organizing thrice-weekly stand-up
meetings to keep our initiatives on track. I also leverage my understanding of
the US market to provide marketing insights, manage our IT tools, and conduct
data analysis to support our business strategy.

We shifted our product focus from high-value oil paintings to more accessible
fashion items and rebranded from _Artlibera_ to _Medouo_ to better align with
this new direction.
